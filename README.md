# How To Run

```scala

 sbt ~fastOptMobile //DEV mode
 
     or 
 
 sbt ~fullOptMobile  // Prod mode
    
 // this will generate index.ios.js and index.android.js files 
 
 
```

that's it now `sri` part is done, everything else is react-native, please follow https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html to setup and run your app in iOS/android simulator/device.
